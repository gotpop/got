Your website must itself be declared a Hugo module.

Go modules are updated via the use of Git tags.

Go modules inside the website are in memory and will not be rendered to the file system.
### Files

If you wish to view the files within the project you can use `hugo mod vender` this will render the files to a directory called `_vender` in the websiteÂ´s project root.
